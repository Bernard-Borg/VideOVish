# VideOVish
A minimalist video player app which supports MP4, OGG and WEBM, MKV and MOV formats (can also play MP3 audio files) - made with Electron!

## Features

The feature set and interface of the video player was inspired by both Windows' Films & TV app and the YouTube video player. The interface is quite simple and the video player has a number of features;

- Forwarding and rewinding the video (buttons/hotkeys)
- Speeding up and slowing down the video (through the S and D hotkeys)
- Increasing and decreasing volume (through the up and down arrows)
- Video seeking (hotkeys 0 - 9, similar to the YouTube player)
- Loop mode
- Full screen mode
- Playing a video from Youtube (using the URL)

## Further possible improvements

Any suggestions are welcome (feel free to open any Issues with improvement suggestions). Despite this, I work full time and might not have too much available time to work on them.

Thinking about;

- Switching to Tailwind for CSS
- Searching for YouTube videos (this is a quite a bit more complicated than I thought, so bear with me)
- Reducing file size

## Contributions

App ideas and bug testing were assisted by my friends [RPC263](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSeiYh0FIlEvGGxT49LK2ew) and [BabyYoda2001](https://github.com/BabyYoda2001) 

Thank you Robert Condorache for your [review](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Video-Players/VideOVish.shtml). 
The majority of your suggestions have been implemented/are in the works.
