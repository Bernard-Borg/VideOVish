# VideoPlayerApp
A minimalist video player app which supports MP4, OGG and WEBM, MKV and MOV formats (can also play MP3 audio files) - made with Electron!

## Features

The feature set and interface of the video player was inspired by both Windows' Films & TV app and the YouTube video player. The interface is quite simple and the video player has a number of features;

- Forwarding and rewinding the video (buttons/hotkeys)
- Speeding up and slowing down the video (through the S and D hotkeys)
- Increasing and decreasing volume (through the up and down arrows)
- Video seeking (hotkeys 0 - 9, similar to the YouTube player)
- Loop mode
- Full screen mode
